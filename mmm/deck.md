## Who Here Has Heard of:

- The Mythical Man Month?
- Fred Brooks?
- Brook's Law?

## Fred Brooks

- recently retired from University of North Carolina after teaching for 51 years
- he worked at IBM in 60's (back when IBM mattered...)
- system architect, computer scientist and software engineer
- designed operating systems when every new computer had a new operating system
- he is an Evangelical Christian (fun fact withing a fun fact...)

## He Shared his Personal Reflections

His personal reflections were collected in a book of essays entitled the Mythical Man Month that describes his experiences and observations building operating system in the early 1960's.

## Big Idea

Adding extra manpower to a software project that is already late will make the software project even more late.

---
## In Detail

- Suppose you measure work units of time as "man-months": how much work a human can do in one month
- For example, you could say that project X will take 10 humans 10 months to complete
- But... What if after 5 months it is observed that the project is not 50% complete but only 25% complete...
- Mathematically, that suggests that a 1 human on this project can complete 2.5% of the project every 5 months
- So... add 20 more!
- But... adding 20 more people will NOT make the project complete in the next 5 months -- it will probably make it take even longer
- hence the name: Myth in Mythical Man Month

## Obvious Causes

- hidden cost of increased work coordination
- hidden cost of increased intra-communication, meetings, etc

---

## Subtle Reasons

- Fixing a software defect has a substantial (20-50%) chance of introducing another. So the whole process is two steps forward and one step back.
- More specialized sub-task workers usually means fewer people comprehensive understanding all the code, introducing more issues that are harder to detect and harder to fix

## The Solution?

Read the Book :)
